Key Components:
- Input Data: The system takes a marked grid of parking spaces, representing the layout and current occupancy of the parking lot.
- Models Used: Three different models have been deployed and compared for classification:
  - Own Simple Model: A custom-designed model tailored to the specific needs of parking space classification.
  - EfficientNetV2S: Leveraging the EfficientNetV2S architecture for high efficiency and accuracy.
  - ConvNeXtTiny: Utilizing ConvNeXtTiny, known for its compact design and strong performance.
- Visualization of Results: The code is capable of displaying the results visually, marking free spaces in red and occupied spaces in green.


Project Workflow:
- Data Preprocessing: Processing and preparing the marked grid of parking spaces for analysis.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Training the three models on the dataset and comparing their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and computational resources.
- Real-time Classification: Implementing the trained models to classify parking spaces in real-time, providing valuable information for drivers and parking management.
- Visualization: Presenting the results in a visual format, with clear color coding to indicate the status of each parking space.


Impact and Applications:
- Smart Parking Systems: Integration into smart parking solutions, guiding drivers to available spaces and optimizing parking lot usage.
- Urban Planning: Assisting in the planning and design of parking facilities, with data-driven insights into occupancy patterns.
